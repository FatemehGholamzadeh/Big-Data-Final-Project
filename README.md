this repository consists of my final project for Big data course under Supervision of Prof. Mostafa Chehreghani at Amirkabir University of Technology.
the code is an reproduction of results stated in this paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-018-0603-9 


one of the algorithms proposed in the paper is as follows:

## Experiments and Results:

in this section results that we obtained after reproducing the paper are showed:

Comparison of the accuracy with respect to the size of the subgraph of an out-of-sample extended mode:


Mean of Accuracies of the classification:
